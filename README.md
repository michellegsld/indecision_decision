## Make decisions for the indecisive

#### An application that currently helps you decide on what to eat. ####


Indecisive decision is a project that aims to help indecisive people decide on a variety of different subjects. Can't decide of a restaurant to go to, we'll decide for you. Don't know what to make for dinner, we'll help you figure it out. There are more planned expansions in the future, but that is the main idea of the program.

## Decisionmakers:

### Restaurant Decider:

The restaurant decider will help you decide where to eat. Give it your location, and hit roll. Want a bit more control of where you go? Add an optional rating, and price range for your restaurant. If you really can't make a decision, set your results to a lower number, or if you don't want any choice at all hit "I'm Feeling Lucky" to give you a single option.

When the results appear, there are a few options avaialable to you, if don't you like all the results given to you, and want something narrower, you can reroll with less options. If you like a lot of the options presented to you, but only can choose one, you have the abiity to favorite multiple restaurants for later viewing on the profile screen.
